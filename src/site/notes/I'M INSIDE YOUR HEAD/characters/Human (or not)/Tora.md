### Generic Information
![tora.png|300](/img/user/zhut%20the%20fuck%20up%20images/shut%20up/tora.png)
**Name(s):** Tora Angarsdottir 
	**Titles:** Champion of Destruction
	**Nickname(s):** Grandma
**Gender:** Female
**Age:** 19
**Birthplace:** Jinvalt, Akaton
**Current residence:** Flauneth, Akaton
**Occupation:** Chronos SU Response Berserker
**Religion:** Doesn’t align with anything specific.
**Nationality/Race:** 3rd gen Akatonite with some Icelandic roots, so white.
**Voice:** Middle-register, rather expressive. Has a lot of range that she can do.
**What do they think of themself?** Not a fan of the grey hair. Like any 19 year old girl, there are things she’d want to change about her appearance, but she’s fairly comfortable with her looks.
*Birthday:* August 16th, 2047-E5
### Appearance/Physical Specifics

**Hair:** Very long grey and red hair. The undersides and tips are a bright crimson, commonly tied up into a ponytail during the day. When she's off-duty, she'll put it in various, more interesting styles. When she's just on her own, she wears it down. 
**Eyes:** Crimson progeny eyes. Top eyelid is a little flat (like in portrait). Long lashes.
**Height:** 5'5
**Notable attributes/features:** I've never actually indicated her wearing it, but she has a weird headpiece. I don't know where it comes from. 
**Physical appearance:** Slender with good muscle definition. Trained for functionality and strength over appearance. 
**Physical condition:** In good health. 
**Style of clothes:** On her own, she likes to wear "cute" things. Pretty much streetwear, but with more effort put in than what Rem might wear. 
**How do they feel about their appearance?** Has mostly accepted her perpetually grey hair, but does wish it was either black or white, if it's gonna be grey scale. Most people do think she looks relatively cool (as long as she doesn't stare at them for too long), so she's glad about that. ==Doesn't stop her from being slightly insecure about her appearance sometimes—pretends she's okay but she's being a hide the pain Harold.==

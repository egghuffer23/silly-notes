**UPDATE THE GOOGLE DOC IF YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS ONE**
### Generic Information

White guy jumpscare
![IMG_4970 1.jpg|300](/img/user/zhut%20the%20fuck%20up%20images/shut%20up/IMG_4970%201.jpg)

**Name(s):** Rem Aldrich
	**Titles:** Scion of Creation, (Monalatus) Aegis
	**Nickname(s):** Grump, Eldritch Horror 
**Gender:** Male
**Age:** 19 (might turn 20 at some point idk) 
**Birthplace:** Jinvalt, Akaton
**Current residence:** Flauneth, Akaton
**Occupation:** (Originally) Uni student - (Officially) Mech pilot - (Unofficially) Scion of Creation
**Religion:** It’s of little importance to him, but normally somewhere around agnostic. Also associated with the Archeophim in a non-religious capacity.
**Nationality/Race:** Akatonite - White (half-Karosian but that means basically nothing genetically speaking)
**Voice:** Somewhat deadpan, and a little softspoken or smooth I guess. Not particularly deep, but not high either. (Softer Yuri Lowenthal LMAO) 
**What do they think of themself?** He’s never particularly thought that positively of himself. He still has basic self-respect, but he’s more likely to put himself down than not. 
*Birthday:* April 10th, 2047-E5
### Appearance/Physical Specifics

**Hair:** Starts as chestnut brown. Quickly turns white and black. Underside eventually becomes aqua. The length is always inconsistent as shit just because of how certain things with him work. Sometimes it's really long, other times it's "short" like in his profile picture. 
**Eyes:** Start as a dark brown. Primarily aqua with a bit of sky blue. 
**Height:** 5’11 (occasionally 6’2) 
**Notable attributes/features:** Has a big-ass mark over his chest (his stigmata). It’s a reflection of how he died in his previous life. It initially looks like just a tapered line over his sternum, but it eventually expands out in a fragmented pattern similar to how the monalatus wing looks. In those segments, the skin gains an adamantine lustre and a slight, light-blueish tint. He’s also (probably gonna be) described as looking like if Sonathea was having a really bad day. 
**Physical appearance:** Initially a little bony cuz he didn’t get up to much. Then gained some muscle cuz being the Aegis is a physically demanding job.
**Physical condition:** Pretty healthy. Doesn’t have any significant health issues. 
**Style of clothes:** Normal/casual by 2060’s standards, so kinda softcore techwear/almost very slightly cyberpunk streetwear if he’s gonna put some effort in. Otherwise he’ll just wear whatever’s clean. 
**How do they feel about their appearance?** 
He’s never been one to worry too much about his appearance. Depending on his mental state at different points in his life, he would give more or less of a shit, but never the entire shit, if you get what I mean. 
### Story-specific Information

**Divinity ranking/species:** Human vessel (progeny subset) 
**Associated Domain:** Creation
**Affiliations:** Chronos, Archeophim 
**Abilities:** Creator’s Aegis (can do various stuff with his built-in mech suit and weapon) 
	Machina Metamorphosis (fancy way to say he can transfigure technology) 
	Adamantine (REALLY high durability. Way higher than a human’s, but not indestructible) 
	Monalatus (typically cannot be activated on command and it’s awful to go through) 
**Weapons/Armour:** R(eplica)-Genisanzlen, Aegis
**How do they feel about their association with the divine?** 
This is a large contention point throughout the story and a large part of Rem’s arc as a character. Initially has no idea wtf it is (denial). Kinda doesn’t know what to make of it and then begins to hate it lol. It’d eventually get to a point where he has to begin to accept things. He never comes around to loving it, but in the end he does acknowledge it and that things won’t go back to normal. 
**Oneiric Field:** A copy of the Temple of Mirrors (Akadriel’s main temple). It’s somewhat dilapidated and covered in crystals, but it ultimately gets better throughout the course of the story (after getting worse at least once). It’s a reflection of Rem’s mental state. 
	*TRUE:* Sonathea’s old home town, but the paths have been reorganized to reflect locations Rem is familiar with. It’s pretty much like a small European beach town, like from Greece or something. It’s overrun with the spikes. 
**Divine-related problems:** He’s stuck with the Aegis inside him and has to deal with his Verselian Bonds. 

### Life History

***(If applicable)* Significant past-life events:** SONATHEA 
**Current-life events:** 
- **First 6 yrs:** Nothing much. Occasionally saw Akadriel hanging around, but he didn’t think much of her. 
- **6 yrs:** Asked his parents about the weird lady floating around. Mom didn’t know what to make of that, and dad pretended he was the same—quietly he was like “ain’t no way.” 
- **7-12 yrs:** Was really into mechs at this point. Forced his dad to take him to look at the simulators and stuff. Akadriel stopped showing up around this period. 
- **14 yrs:** (Shit kinda hit the fan here) Around November, [[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Human (or not)/Tora\|Tora]] suddenly moved away without warning. Rem was incredibly confused and could only message her for a while. She was pretty cryptic about everything.
- [[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Human (or not)/Felix\|Felix]]/Dad goes MIA. Rem ended up on copium due to the weird circumstances of his case.
- **15:** Starts to lose interest in mechs and stuff. Dwindled into mild dysthymia. 
- **16 yrs:** `He and Dante both got their mech licenses since they promised each other they would when they were kids.`
- **17 yrs:** Worked odd jobs outside of high school as a hired mechand for some money. Has long had no interest in piloting, just got his license because it might be useful. 
- The leviathan-class that his father was dispatched to eliminate turned up again, possessing the same fighter Felix fought in. It also had strange new attributes and a signature too musical for an [[Physics/Verselia/Images\|Image]] to have. Rem kinda blacked out (poor control due to Aegis) and went to try and solo that leviathan in the [PUM]. The Aegis was close to activating on its own, resulting in Rem's hair turning plain white, but he was subdued too quickly for it to fully come out. All that ended in his license being revoked. After this event, he began seeing Akadriel regularly again. 
- **18 yrs:** Took a gap year not doing anything. He didn’t know what he wanted to do with himself. 
- **19 yrs:** Current bullshit ensues.
>It doesn’t happen at a specific age, but there have been occasional times where Rem has had weird experiences with technology, like fixing more than one TV by slapping it, or accidentally screwing with wirings. It’s nothing like turning a high grade speaker into a shitty old computer or like what he could otherwise do. 

**What were the circumstances of their birth?** Nothing special. He was being talked about at the time, and then happened somewhat on accident, and that’s about it. Very, very average. The only strange thing about it was when he was fresh outta the womb, he had the stigmata over his chest. 
	This was strange, so his parents had a biopsy scraping done and it came back as just normal-ass skin. He’s just had a random ash-grey stripe-thing over his sternum as long as he’s been breathing air. 
### Occupation

**Education:** Highschool graduate. He was meant to begin in university after taking a gap year. Attempts to go for a bit, but regularly getting stuck in Karos or other dimensions for a while makes for a fair few missed classes. 
**Employment status:** Officially employed as a Chronos special unit. 
**Are they book smart or street smart?** He’s fairly intelligent. Not a dumbass, but also not the top of his classes. He can also navigate around social situations just fine, albeit maybe a little awkwardly sometimes. Not especially one or the other. 
**Qualifications/Certifications:** He did successfully get his mech license, but he ended up getting it revoked lmao 
**Work experience:** Worked as something called a hired mechand for a while, otherwise has had no official employment. 
### Personal Life 

**What do they live in?** (living conditions) 
	Just lives in a dorm. (It’s quite the mess once it becomes a bit more lived-in)
**What does a nice evening look like to them?** 
	Ideally, he’d just be left alone to do things he wants to do without any relation to the gods and whatnot since he’d want a break from it all. He’s happy to have some company from preferably another human. 
**What is the state of their bedroom?** 
	A fucking mess. Everything has its place and he hates people moving things around. 
**Do they have any comfort/important items? If yes, what and why?**
	So far, none lol. 
**Do they have any secrets? If yes, what?**
	As a kid, he had no filter on telling people about seeing a strange floating woman sometimes, but as he got older, he wouldn’t tell anyone when he started seeing her again frequently. 
	After his dumbassery at 17 up until he moved, he’d occasionally get jumpscared by Akadriel turning up. If Lily ever noticed, she’d ask him if it’s the strange woman, but he’d always very unconvincingly say no. She never believed him, though. 
### Psychological

**Motivations:** GET THESE MFING BONDS OFF, survival (at various points), 
**Personality vignette:** Kinda emotionally flat guy who isn’t a big fan of Big Feels. A dork-ass loser.
**Enneagram:** 6w5 apparently (unsure of accuracy — not completely wrong but not entirely him either) 
**Important Traits:** 
- He doesn’t really think he is, but he’s rather empathetic.
	- thinks he's rational/logic based, but he's an emotional motherfucker. 
- Protective instinct. His mom-friend side can awaken. 
- Can be efficient (when he’s not being catatonic). 
- On the surface level, he tends to favour logic too much.
- Cynical/sometimes pessimistic. 
- He’s rife with conflicting emotions. Walking paradox. 
- Stubborn bitch. 
- Has a fear of rejection that manifests in him being withdrawn from others because he (unconsciously) operates under the philosophy that if he doesn’t get close to others, those expectations won’t be formed, and it saves the eventual crash and burn he seems to expect. 
	- If he doesn’t try, then it’s not as bad if he tried and failed. Safe from failure. Afraid of failure.
- Bit of a sassy bitch when he’s not actively stuck neck-deep in batshit happenings. 
**How do they feel about themself?** 
Point dependent. At the beginning, if he got asked this question, he’d answer with a very indecisive answer like “I’m… eh,” so not positively. Does an emotional halfpipe and comes out the other side overall happier with himself. 
**Projected development:**
Begins mildly dysthymic, lost and without purpose. 
Ends up hating his situation. Yeah, it’s kinda what he wanted, but not like this. 
**Ambitions/Obsessions:** Used to want to be a mech pilot like his father. Can't be arsed to do that anymore. Just wants to live a decent life at this point. 
**Psychological state:** Anxious, but also in a bit of a complacent, "stuck" area. I don’t really know where else to put it but he’s touch-starved as all fuck. Definitely gets worse 
**Fears:** Failure and rejection
**What are they proud of?** Doesn't have much he's proud of since he hasn't accomplished much he would consider "noteworthy". 
**What are they ashamed of?** The fact he got his mech license revoked because he acted on so much emotion. 
**Love Language:** i think he’s mainly a slut for praise.
	gift giving he likes when it’s more small, random stuff because it meaningfully shows that the person was thinking of him.  
	can also be a bit of a slut for physical touch, but he prefers not in public. 
	think i’m sleeping on his appreciation of acts of service.
### Miscellaneous

**Likes:** Good food, stupid movies (like Sharknado/Moonfall type movies), oceans, …
**Dislikes:** Slimy things, strenuous activity, praying mantises, etc…
**Hobbies:** Wandering around/exploring random places, etc…
**Random facts:** He regularly uses the in-universe equivalent of reddit and sometimes gets into stupid arguments because he sometimes has nothing better to do with his time. 
**Romantic/Sexual preference:** “You think I know? I’m just out here. Haven’t had a crush in years. I forgot what love feels like, honestly. If you want a proper answer, probably just straight, I dunno.” (hahaaaaa he is now canonically bisexual)
### Relationships 

**What is their family situation?** 
- Father went missing 5 years ago. 2 years ago, all signs ended up pointing to him being dead. Rem was still kinda on copium though. 
	- He used to be close with his dad, but they had limited contact due to his father often being in high-risk situations or being gone for extended periods of time.
- His mom ([[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Side\|Stella]]) is still around — she works in ruin research. Her trips away were her field research trips. *Cularean* ruin archeologist. 
	- Similar situation to Felix. Had times where she would have to leave for extended periods of time, leaving Rem and Lily at home. They’d have a caretaker in place if Felix wasn’t around either, but it wasn’t too often that they were all in the one place at the one time. Once Rem was maybe 16, he’d be left with Lily. By this point, Stella did leave less so she could be with them more.
- Has a younger sister (by 1½ years) named Lily. They’re fairly close and on good terms. Have the sort of relationship where they just send each other random memes/videos without saying too much else most of the time.
**What are their friendships like?** (gender tendency, closeness, how many, etc.) 
	He doesn’t really have a particular tendency. What friends he does have are kinda limited, but he has close bonds with them. He prefers fewer, deeper bonds to multiple shallow ones anyway. 
**General public reception:** He’s usually rather nondescript and prefers not to draw attention to himself, so rather neutrally if you’re watching his behaviour. His appearance is a little more gaudy, much to his chagrin, so him just walking by may attract attention.
**Enemies:** He’d answer this as technically Riorel, however he doesn’t have many personal stakes against him. (to begin with)

### Meta

**My opinion on them:** Idk if he’s like a weird self-insert or what (albeit a very different appearing one). I put quite a few of my own traits into him and the themes of this story as well as what I hope to accomplish with Rem are very personal to me :,)
**Intended reader opinion:** He’s meant to be a bit of an everyman that people can see themselves in, but still also be a "distinct" character. Also kind of meant to call out the reader (as in being like, ‘ah, same’) but still meant to be routed for. 
**What is the point of the character?** …Protagonist. There isn’t really a story without him lol.
**Current problems:** 
1. Does his dad live or die? What narrative impacts would either of these have on him?
	- Faldrich probably dies lol rip 
2. One of the story’s themes is acceptance, but I don’t wanna mentally destroy Rem either.
### Uncategorized/Extra 

**What happens when there are no clean dishes in the house?** 
	Initially he’d just order take out and refuse to touch the dishes since someone else can do them. Later on he’d actually do them, albeit reluctantly.
**What happens when something goes wrong?** 
	DISAPPEAR INTO THE OCEAN. 
**What do they do when there’s a thunderstorm?** 
	He doesn’t really care. If someone’s scared, he’ll probably try and look after them. 
**What sort of music do they like?** 
	Idk what it’d be specifically but it’s strange. 
**What happens when they’re handed the AUX cord?** 
	Initially he’d wanna just be skipped because he thinks the stuff he likes is cringe, or he’d just very heavily curate the songs to what he thinks is normal music. Later on, he’d just cue up some of his more normal stuff but throw in the odd curveball of strange things he would never listen to, like metal pipe clanging compilations. 
**What do they do when they’re in a petty online argument?** 
	Will reply with actual arguments until he gives up because the other person is too stupid or he’s losing. 
### Important Relationships

**[[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Archeophim/1 - Akadriel\|Akadriel]]**
	It’s definitely rough at first. They’re meant to bicker a fair amount, but Akadriel ultimately still cares for him, as does he. She does not express this properly due to her nature at the time, but once she cracks, she would be better at it. 
	She can end up mothering him, but with the amount of goading she does
**[[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Human (or not)/Aluaris\|Aluaris]]**
	He and Sonathea used to be something like sworn brothers (though they both now have unresolved feelings for one another). Lingering feelings of this familiarity carry over, but Rem doesn’t understand it. Aluaris doesn’t really either, but he goes along with it more than Rem does. They’ve got the whole “I don’t know why, but I feel like I can trust you” dynamic to some degree (at least for a bit). 
**Tora**
**[[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Human (or not)/Felix\|Felix]] Aldrich (dad)** 
	Rem really used to look up to him, wanting to follow in his footsteps, become a mech pilot and whatnot. Felix then disappeared in an unusual circumstance without much real indicator of whether he's dead or alive. Due to this, Rem has been unsure how to process Felix's disappearance, appearing to lean more towards thinking he's dead, when he has (a bit more subconsciously) clung to hoping he's still alive.  
### Additional Side Crap
…in the end, i think sonathea would have wanted to join riorel’s semi-assimilation-plot-new-world thing. 

***WHAT DOES REM BELIEVE ABOUT HIMSELF?*** 
- Wants to be able to help people, but fears people placing their trust in him since he fears that he will let them down. 
- motivated by the need to acquire security and social support?
### Voice Notes
- Dry speech and humour
- Kinda just talks like me. 
- Stutters a little when nervous

Sonathea vs Rem 
bishie-ass facial proportions
(meant to be very similar-looking)

Conceptual Image-like form. Probably feels a bit like a smooth silicon on the softer bits. Slightly squishy texture. Knock on him in some parts and it sounds like you’re knocking on metal.

(can’t really explain myself on this one. I just wanted to make him weird-looking)
**literally why does he have a tail? there's zero lore reason for it other than i like tails 
	`sapient, humanoid images can end up having tails. meant to differentiate them a bit from humans, separating them a bit more as weird-ass creatures that are suspiciously human-like since that's more what they are. though they very well could just be suspiciously weird-looking humans. 

**There's plenty of shit he hates, but what does he like? lmao**

core belief???
> if he doesn’t move, he’ll maybe gain security? security is found in stillness

people usually need to reach out to him first to have any contact. you’ll know he’s close to mentally going down the shitter if he reaches out first. will find multiple excuses to just keep talking if he can but will clam up a bit if he gets asked if he’s okay. soggy bitch.

HE KEEPS GETTING MORE AND MORE FEMME. ![IMG_6348.png](/img/user/zhut%20the%20fuck%20up%20images/shut%20up/IMG_6348.png)
yikes those are very thick legs lmfao

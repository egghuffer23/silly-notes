#### Working Elevator Pitch 

A human learns he has always been involved in the gods’ fighting, now featuring mechs and ulterior dimensions.

>[!abstract]- Further Elaborated
Roughly every 5000 years, a sealed god makes his slow return into the coexistent worlds of Earth and Karos. Due to the devastating effects of this god’s powers and the ultimate goal to unite the two realms into one, the very integrity of the worlds is coming apart at the seams. The main character, [[I'M INSIDE YOUR HEAD/characters/Human (or not)/Rem\|Rem]], is dragged into the centre of the next incoming divine war because half of a god is entangled with both his soul and physical body. As one of the key figures in the holy war, Rem must aid in recollecting the scattered gods and fighting to survive. But how do you do that in the decade of the 2060s? The obvious answer would be mechs, especially when you’ve already got one inside you.

#### What do I want to try and do with it?

Kind of an attempt to explore grief, identity, hope and their interplay, as well as express my own trials and tribulations under the guise of random shit I find cool. Also just write shit I find cool while also trying to write something with artistic value lmao.
#### Genre 
* Fantasy if it beat up and stole Sci-fi’s clothes in an alleyway, so science fantasy. 
* Some mech. It's not all that's going on, but they're in it a fair amount. (Lowkey feel like I oversell the mech aspect to some degree)
#### Recurring Imagery 

* Softcore solarpunk
* High-tech ruins
* Shipping-yard-core (thanks Puppet)
* (Sometimes technologized) religious/angelic imagery. I'm not really sure, it's a bit of a mixed bag.
#### Story Foci 

1. Divine Bullshit: crap involving the gods and the world, so how the Archeophim affect the world and everything else following.
2. Technology: the gods have a lot of technological involvement, so there's a fair amount of that crap too.
3. Whatever else I need to build/develop to maintain the illusion of having a coherent world where things are actually happening.
#### Bullshit Story Specs 

* It'd ideally be a trilogy?
* In terms of potential final word count (for this first thing), I've pulled the number 120,000 somewhere out of the aether. Could very well be more since I haven't properly outlined this thing (uh-oh). 
* Current title for it is GODSend. Another title if that one doesn't work out for whatever reason is (Genesis Fugue) Adamantine Symphony.

[[Physics/Verselia/Verselia\|Verselian]] apparitions. Typically rather ephemeral, most often spawning from [[Physics/God Chicanery/Distortion Spikes\|Distortion Spikes]], but they have been recorded to exist in history before distortion spikes were a thing. They're essentially just clumps of verselia that sometimes happen to form as a result of distortion. In the past, Images could form if there was enough condensed verselia in one place. 

Ghosts are a type of Image, but a highly non-corporeal one as they have only the faintest of touches. You can blow walk through them like a cloud, but still feel their presence since you're walking through a column of familiar verselia. You can also still feel the "ghost" of their touch. 

Kroaxis is a once-dead soul that ~~COULDA COME BACK WRONG AHAHHAHH~~ possessed an Image. 
When an End [[Divininas/Theophim\|theophim]] was trying to disconnect her soul from her body, she was clinging onto her body out of sheer desperation to live. An Image had drawn up and was knocking into the End theophim, briefly distracting it. Kroaxis reached out and moved into the Image instead. The End theophim was confused since it hadn't actually severed her connection, but there was no trace of a soul in her body. She wrested control over the Image's form, and since it had probably the same intelligence as a sea cucumber, it wasn't hard. 

Limarael will turn up if you get an End Theophim to freak out and send an error message. Since they're so infrequent, he will show up to see what's going on. This particular Theophim could sort of recognize Kroaxis's soul within the Image, but was confused by the amount of distortion. It scanned her and read as a dual image/human construct. It can't compute that she is in a disembodied state but isn't submerged so it sends out an error. Limarael shows up to see what's going on. Looks at Kroaxis but also "sees" her as being a jumbled mess between an Image and a human. Confused, he has to take off his blindfold to understand what's happening in front of him. Sees her as a glitching human. She's just frozen because holy shit that's the literal avatar of the End that has just shown up AND taken off his blindfold.

L: What happened to you? 
K: Wait, p-please, I don't want to die. 
L: That can be addressed in a moment, but tell me what happened. You are an Image?
K: I—I don't know, an Image turned up and distracted the Theophim while it was trying to take me, so I... I reached out for the Image and then overtook it or something. I swear, I didn't know what I was doing. 
L: Your tie to this plane feels weak. Was the Theophim trying to sever you? 
K: It'd begun the process?
L: I'm assuming you were resisting. 
K: Y-yeah.
L: Don't feel guilty. It's natural. You have, however, now cheated death.
K: *fear*
L: It was granted by chance, and you took it. Sometimes the end isn’t the true end, so perhaps there is more for you to do. 
K: What?
L: I will let you go. 
K: Holy fuck—
L: However, I cannot guarantee that End Theophim will not try and take you. Some might detect your weakened tie. There is nothing that can be done about it. 


Sentient images tend to get progenies confused with other sentient images. 
- they can kinda "see" versigs, so people will have auras around them or on them. Rem looks like he's covered in more aedifene patterning than just what's on his chest/arm. 

Classes
> **leviathan:** huge fucking Images that are over 60ft tall. can get way taller than that. 
> **Central:** (consider renaming) Riorels
> **Sentient:** not a real class since their existence isn't known.
> *Standard*: idk what to call them, but these are just normal-ass images that plod along and try to eat verselia.

*breaking through album cover art lmao.* stolen example of a possible leviathan. would look a bit less human than that, but this thing could be like... idk it looks like an image pertaining to obsidian if it got possessed by a bit of riorel vers lmao.

what makes images grow or whatever when they get attacked/broken in any parts? 

*can images feel pain and shit? because i tend to default to giving them pained/enraged reactions.* 
> i guess as you go up the ranks they can display more and more behaviour that resembles a living creature. their consciousness is minimal and they don’t have a concept of self-awareness or thought or anything, but if you got a leviathan to somehow cooperate (good luck), you might find it has the intelligence of a household cat. 
> once it finally gains self-awareness, then it will become humanoid. 
> grunts have zero reaction to anything
> standard might make a sound and increase in swarm behaviour, but that’s about it. 
> titans will get enraged. they might appear to feel pain but they don’t. it’s a rage reaction. 
> leviathans are actually developing pain and awareness and all that, so yes they feel both pain and rage. 

*can images ascend to godhood?*
they can work their way up the ranks i guess? but they won’t be equivalent to an archeophim who are primordial and direct subsets of order.
